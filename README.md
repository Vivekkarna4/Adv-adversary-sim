# Advanced Adversary Simulation & Purple Team Detection

## Overview
This project simulates a real-world adversary attack in an isolated enterprise lab and evaluates how effectively it can be detected and improved using SOC tooling and Purple Team methodology.

## Architecture
- Kali Linux (Attacker)
- Windows 10 (Initial Access)
- Windows Server (Active Directory)
- Ubuntu ELK (SIEM)
- Malware Analysis VM (Ghidra)

## Key Features
- Sliver C2–based adversary simulation
- ELK SIEM with Sysmon & Beats
- MITRE ATT&CK–mapped attack chain
- Malware analysis using Ghidra
- Purple Team simulate–detect–improve workflow

## Skills Demonstrated
- Detection Engineering
- SOC Analysis
- Adversary Emulation
- Malware Static Analysis
- MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
