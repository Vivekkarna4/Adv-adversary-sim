# Ghidra Malware Analysis Lab

## Objective
Perform static malware analysis on a suspicious payload detected by the SIEM
to understand its behavior and improve security detections.

## Scope
- Static analysis only
- No execution of malware
- Lab-generated payloads only

## Tools Used
- Ghidra
- Hashing utilities

## Environment
- Isolated Malware Analysis VM
- No internet connectivity

## Lab Workflow
1. Identify suspicious binary from SIEM alert
2. Securely extract binary from endpoint
3. Import binary into Ghidra
4. Analyze imports, strings, and decompiled code
5. Map behavior to MITRE ATT&CK
