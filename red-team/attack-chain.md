# Attack Chain Overview

The adversary simulation follows a structured attack chain aligned with MITRE ATT&CK:

1. Reconnaissance
2. Initial Access
3. Execution & Command-and-Control
4. Persistence
5. Credential Access
6. Lateral Movement
7. Data Exfiltratio

Each phase is executed sequentially and validated through Blue Team detections.
